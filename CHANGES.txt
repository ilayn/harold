ChangeLog
============

v0.1.1b5
--------
+ Requirement of NumPy is changed to 1.13 and above. Among others, we need
  `__array_ufunc__` override mechanism for representation algebra. This
  should not be an issue since noone seems to use this.
+ The representations can now be sliced with `G[:,1:3]` etc.


v0.1.1b4
--------
+ Sanitized the circular dependencies a bit more
+ minimal_realization is changed to accept models instead of A,B,C triplet
+ minimal_realization for Transfer uses the pole zero cancellation check
+ more housekeeping and bug fixes
+ added damping, natural frequency properties of poles
- state_to_transfer does not return minimal realizations (per request)

v0.1.1b3
--------
+ More tests
+ bode, nyquist plots with matplotlib
+ Rewritten the transmission_zeros to improve accuracy
- Removed the single file and replaced it with modular files.
- Refactored Riccati solvers to SciPy official repo
- Lyapunov solver safety net is moot. Created PR #6775 in SciPy

v0.1.1b2
--------
+ Added Riccati solvers
+ More documentation
+ Added safety net for lyapunov solvers in case there is no solution

v0.1.1b1
--------
+ Added Lyapunov solvers
+ Fixed many bugs
- Removed block diag and switched to scipy version

v0.1.1a
-------
+ Initial versioning and packaging.
+ Adding documentation and Sphinx integration.
+ Basically everything there is.
