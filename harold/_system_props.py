    """
    Computes the system p-norm. Currently, no balancing is done on the
    system, however in the future, a scaling of some sort will be introduced.
    Another short-coming is that while sounding general, only
    :math:`\\mathcal{H}_2` and :math:`\\mathcal{H}_\\infty`
    norm are understood.

    For :math:`\\mathcal{H}_2` norm, the standard grammian definition via
    controllability grammian, that can be found elsewhere is used.

    Currently, the :math:`\\mathcal{H}_\\infty` norm is computed via
    so-called Boyd-Balakhrishnan-Bruinsma-Steinbuch algorithm [1]_.

    .. [1] N.A. Bruinsma, M. Steinbuch: Fast Computation of
        :math:`\\mathcal{H}_\\infty`-norm of transfer function. System and
        Control Letters, 14, 1990

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : {State,Transfer}
        System for which the norm is computed
    p : {int,Inf}
        Whether the rank of the matrix should also be reported or not.
        The returned rank is computed via the definition taken from the
        official numpy.linalg.matrix_rank and appended here.
    max_iter_limit: int
        Stops the iteration after max_iter_limit many times spinning the
        loop. Very unlikely but might be required for pathological examples.
    hinf_tol: float
        When the progress is below this tolerance the result is accepted
        as *converged*.
    eig_tol: float
        The algorithm relies on checking the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian
        being on the imaginary axis or not. This value is the threshold
        such that the absolute real value of the eigenvalues smaller than
        this value will be accepted as pure imaginary eigenvalues.

    Returns
    -------
    n : float
