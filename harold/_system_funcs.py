    """
    Given a state model data A, B, C, Returns the so-called staircase form
    State realization to assess the controllability/observability properties.

    If observer-form is requested, internally the system is pertransposed
    and same controllable-form machinery is applied.

    Parameters
    ----------
    A : (n, n) array_like
        State array
    B : (n, m) array_like
        Input array
    C : (p, n) array_like
        Output array
    form : str, optional
        Determines whether the controller- or observer-staircase form
        will be computed via "c" or "o" values.
    invert : bool, optional
        If True, the full rank part of B/C matrix will be compressed to
        lower/right part of the array. Naturally, this also effects the A
        matrix blocks to appear as lower/upper triangular block matrix.

    Returns
    -------
    Ah : (n, n) ndarray
        Resulting State array
    Bh : (n, m) ndarray
        Resulting Input array
    Ch : (p, n) ndarray
        Resulting Output array
    T : (n, n) ndarray
        The transformation matrix such that ::

            [ T⁻¹AT | T⁻¹B ]   [ Ah | Bh ]
            [-------|------] = [----|----]
            [   CT  |      ]   [ Ch |    ]

    Notes
    -----
    For controllability and observability, the existence of zero subdiagonal
    blocks can be checked in a numerically stable fashion, as opposed to
    forming the  Kalman matrices and checking the rank. For certain matrices,
    A^n computations can introduce large errors (for some A that have entries
    with varying order of magnitudes). But it is also prone to numerical
    rank identification.
