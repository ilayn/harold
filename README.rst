harold
======

A control systems package for Python>=3.6.

Introduction
============

This package is written with the ambition of providing a full-fledged control
systems software that serves a control engineer/student/researcher with complete
access to the source code with permissive rights (see ``LICENSE`` file). 
Moreover, via working with a proper high-level computer programming language
many proprietary software obstacles are avoided and users can incorporate this
package into their workflow in any way they see fit.

Quick Reference and Documentation
---------------------------------

The documentation is online at `ReadTheDocs`_. A brief tutorial about the basics
can be found under the notebooks folder to see ``harold`` in action.

Roadmap
-------

The items that are in the pipeline and what possibly lies ahead is enumerated
in our `roadmap <https://github.com/ilayn/harold/wiki/harold-roadmap>`_.

Useful Links
------------

- There is already an almost-matured control toolbox which is led by
  Richard Murray et al. (`click for the Github page`_) and it can perform
  already most of the essential tasks. Hence, if you want to have
  something that resembles the basics of matlab control toolbox, you should give
  it a try. However, it is somewhat limited to SISO tools and also relies on
  SLICOT library which can lead to installation hassle and/or licensing
  problems for nontrivial tasks.

- You can also use the tools available in SciPy ``signal`` module for basics
  of LTI system manipulations. SciPy is a powerful all-purpose scientific
  package. This makes it extremely useful however admittedly every discipline
  has a limited presence hence the limited functionality. If you are looking
  for a quick LTI system manipulation and don't want to install yet another
  package, then it might be the tool for you.

- Instead, if you are interested in robust control you probably would
  appreciate the `Skogestad-Python`_ project. They are replicating the
  code parts of the now-classic book completely in Python. Awesome!
